# Data-Augmentation-Basic-Predictions-of-the-Image
In this project, we explore Data Augmentation, a crucial technique for enhancing image datasets, and build a basic prediction pipeline for image classification. Augmentation helps improve the generalization of machine learning models by creating diverse versions of the training data.
